# NewsAppWithModelViewController

This sample project shows you how to use the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern with UITableView. 

I used objective C for this tutorial. 

### Need To Know
The app shows the user the top news from CNN. [newsapi.org](https://newsapi.org) is used to get the hot news. Please register and get a key from newsapi.org. It is free :)

AFNetworking is used for getting news. It is used very basically but if you want to learn what AFNetworking is, please visit [AFNetworking Project Page] (https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking).
